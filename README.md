WooURLMe
========

Yet another URL Shortener that I've created to just play around with code.

Includes an implementation of a custom encoder/decoder for shortened links which I call WooBase (Base 51 of a custom set of characters).

Technologies used:
* C#
* ASP .NET MVC
* Web API
* Knockout JS
* Bootstrap
