WooURLMe
========

Yet another URL Shortener that I've created to just play around with code.

Includes an implementation of a custom encoder/decoder for shortened links which I call WooBase (Base 51 of a custom set of characters).

Technologies used:
* C#
* ASP .NET MVC
* Web API
* Knockout JS
* Bootstrap

This site is currently deployed to AppHarbor: http://woourlme.apphb.com

I should also note that this is a really good candidate to use a NoSQL database. I have yet to learn any of the available technologies but may tackle that sometime later.
